Move to release page\n2. Download the file for your platform.\n3. Just run the file.(java needed. Most of the conditions are the same as the original version.)\n\n### Information\n\n- Discord : _https://discord.gg/g8R9XTK_\n\n### Translating support\n\n1. move to core/asset/bundle/\n2. open bundle_(language code).properties\n3. Compare and work with bundle.properties.\n4. If you need more advice, read Translating.md\n\n`_Translating is similar to the original._`\n\n### Or...\nIf you want to experience the latest version, please follow the instructions below.\n\n\u203b All builds must be done with commands within the master folder.\n\n#### Windows\n\n_Running:_ `gradlew desktop:run`  \n_Building:_ `gradlew desktop:dist`\n\n#### Linux/Mac OS\n\n_Running:_ `./gradlew desktop:run`  \n_Building:_ `./gradlew desktop:dist`\n\n#### Server\n\nServer builds are bundled with each released build (in Releases). If you'd rather compile on your own, replace 'desktop' with 'server', e.g. `gradlew server:dist`.\n\n#### Android\n\n1. Install the Android SDK [here.](https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads) Make sure you're downloading the \"Command line tools only\", as Android Studio is not required.\n2. Create a file named `local.properties` inside the Mindustry directory, with its contents looking like this: `sdk.dir=<Path to Android SDK you just downloaded, without these bracket>`. For example, if you're on Windows and installed the tools to C:\\\\tools, your local.properties would contain `sdk.dir=C:\\\\tools` (*note the double backslashes are required instead of single ones!*).\n3. Run `gradlew android:assembleDebug` (or `./gradlew` if on linux/mac). This will create an unsigned APK in `android/build/outputs/apk`.\n4. (Optional) To debug the application on a connected phone, do `gradlew android:installDebug android:run`. It is **highly recommended** to use IntelliJ for this instead, however.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\nIf the terminal returns `Permission denied` or `Command not found` on Mac/Linux, run `chmod +x ./gradlew` before running `./gradlew`. *This is a one-time procedure.*\n\n---\n\nGradle may take up to several minutes to download files. Be patient. <br>\nAfter building, the output .JAR file should be in `/desktop/build/libs/Mindustry.jar` for desktop builds, and in `/server/build/libs/server-release.jar` for server builds.\n", "version": null, "wiki": null, "date": "2019-12-18 15:43:53", "header": "", "delta_ago": "9 days"}, {"name": "\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0456\u0437\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0412\u0441\u0435\u0441\u0432\u0456\u0442\u0443", "link": "https://github.com/Prosta4okua/Ukrajinisator", "desc": "\u041d\u0435\u0445\u0430\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0438 \u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0430\u043c \u0432 \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0442\u0456 \u043f\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438!", "icon": null, "icon_raw": "", "stars": 1, "author": "Prosta4ok_ua", "date_tt": 1576622507.0, "repo": "Prosta4okua/Ukrajinisator", "contents": [], "assets": ["bundles"], "issue": null, "readme": "# Ukrajinisator\n\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0456\u0437\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440. \u0426\u0438\u043c \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u043e.\n", "version": "1", "wiki": null, "date": "2019-12-17 17:41:47", "header": "", "delta_ago": "10 days"}, {"name": "Materialplus", "link": "https://github.com/Lukince/Material-Plus", "desc": "This mod is Material Plus Mod for Mindustry.", "icon": "images/material-plus-icon.png", "icon_raw": "sprites/blocks/uranium-reactor.png", "stars": 2, "author": "lukince", "date_tt": 1576522904.0, "repo": "Lukince/Material-Plus", "contents": ["blocks", "items", "liquids"], "assets": ["sprites", "sounds", "content", "bundles"], "issue": null, "readme": "# Info\nThis mod is Material Plus Mod for Mindustry\n\n[https://anuke.itch.io/mindustry]\n\n1.0 Version hasn't sprites.\n\nTranslation:\nKorean : Lukince\nEnglish(Fix) : Phythongaming\n\nBug(Translation) report : reportbug0@gmail.com\"\n\n# Version Update\n\n- 1.0\n\nTurrets : 5 Turrets are Updated\n\nBlock : 3 Forges and 1 Reactor are Updated\n\nItem : 2 Items are Updated\n\nLiquid : 1 Liquid is Updated\n\n- 1.01 Patch Note\n\nTwo blocks are patched.\n\nUranium Forge : Power changed, Power : 4,000 -> 1,000\n\nUranium Melter : Power and craftTime changed, Power : 3,000 -> 600, craftTime : 2sec -> 0.92 sec\n\nAdd two sprites : Titanium forge and Ion generator.\n\nTranslate Titanium forge\n", "version": "1.01", "wiki": null, "date": "2019-12-16 14:01:44", "header": "", "delta_ago": "12 days"}, {"name": "Better Builds Mod", "link": "https://github.com/pyro000/Mindustry-BetterBuildsMod", "desc": "Mod dise\u00f1ado por Ruben, el cual trae diversos items nurvos, como nether, estrellas, obsidiana, lingotes nucleares, torretas, un proyector de fuerza...

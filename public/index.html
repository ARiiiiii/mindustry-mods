Move to release page\n2. Download the file for your platform.\n3. Just run the file.(java needed. Most of the conditions are the same as the original version.)\n\n### Information\n\n- Discord : _https://discord.gg/g8R9XTK_\n\n### Translating support\n\n1. move to core/asset/bundle/\n2. open bundle_(language code).properties\n3. Compare and work with bundle.properties.\n4. If you need more advice, read Translating.md\n\n`_Translating is similar to the original._`\n\n### Or...\nIf you want to experience the latest version, please follow the instructions below.\n\n\u203b All builds must be done with commands within the master folder.\n\n#### Windows\n\n_Running:_ `gradlew desktop:run`  \n_Building:_ `gradlew desktop:dist`\n\n#### Linux/Mac OS\n\n_Running:_ `./gradlew desktop:run`  \n_Building:_ `./gradlew desktop:dist`\n\n#### Server\n\nServer builds are bundled with each released build (in Releases). If you'd rather compile on your own, replace 'desktop' with 'server', e.g. `gradlew server:dist`.\n\n#### Android\n\n1. Install the Android SDK [here.](https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads) Make sure you're downloading the \"Command line tools only\", as Android Studio is not required.\n2. Create a file named `local.properties` inside the Mindustry directory, with its contents looking like this: `sdk.dir=<Path to Android SDK you just downloaded, without these bracket>`. For example, if you're on Windows and installed the tools to C:\\\\tools, your local.properties would contain `sdk.dir=C:\\\\tools` (*note the double backslashes are required instead of single ones!*).\n3. Run `gradlew android:assembleDebug` (or `./gradlew` if on linux/mac). This will create an unsigned APK in `android/build/outputs/apk`.\n4. (Optional) To debug the application on a connected phone, do `gradlew android:installDebug android:run`. It is **highly recommended** to use IntelliJ for this instead, however.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\nIf the terminal returns `Permission denied` or `Command not found` on Mac/Linux, run `chmod +x ./gradlew` before running `./gradlew`. *This is a one-time procedure.*\n\n---\n\nGradle may take up to several minutes to download files. Be patient. <br>\nAfter building, the output .JAR file should be in `/desktop/build/libs/Mindustry.jar` for desktop builds, and in `/server/build/libs/server-release.jar` for server builds.\n"}, {"name": "DE3000/Manufacry", "stars": 2, "date": "2019-10-23 10:22:25", "sha": "53acca501400329652293a1425b319aeffa788d9", "mod": {"name": null, "description": null, "author": null, "version": null, "dependencies": null}, "readme": "#   Manufacry\nBringing more manufacturing and factory components to\n[Mindustry](https://mindustrygame.github.io/).\n\n##### Note\nManufacry is a **code** mod for Mindustry and therefor needs a custom build\n (bleeding edge builds currently will not work).\n##### Releases\nCheck releases page (desktop version only).\n##  Features\n   - [ ] Configurable crafters - Crafters where you can choose what to manufacture.\n   - [ ] Addon modules - Blocks that enhance or modify the functionality of related crafters.\n   - [ ] [Power production](#power-production) - Power generation using steam\n   - [ ] [Oil distillation](#oil-distillation) - Use vanilla oil to produce\n    more refined oils.\n   - [ ] [Factories](#factories) - Produce new items/liquids\n   - [ ] [Workforce](#workforce) - New aircraft and mechs for utility/defense/offence \n   - [ ] [Logic System](#logic-system) - Basic logic circuit components.\n   \n### Power production\n- Steam Power\n    - Steam Pressure\n        - Low pressure steam - moderate heat\n        - High pressure steam - high heat (causes damage on contact)\n    - Steam Boilers\n        - Outputs steam (used for power and oil distillation)\n        - Inputs\n            - Water (vanilla)\n            - Distilled water (more efficient)\n        - Types\n            - Solid Fuelled - Burns items (similar to vanilla steam generator)\n                - Coal - produces low pressure\n                - Blast - produces low pressure\n                - Pyrite - produces high pressure\n            - Liquid Fuelled - Burns liquid fuel\n                - Crude Oil\t(vanilla) - produces low pressure\n                - Fuel Oil\t(distillation) - produces high pressure\n    - Steam Turbine\n        - Uses steam for power\n        - Produces distilled water output\n        - Pressure\n            - Low - less power, less distilled water\n            - High - more power, more distilled water\n- Gas Power\n    - Gas Turbine - Use natural gas for power.\n\n### Oil Distillation\nInspiration from oil refining in other games/mods and also from the image below.\n\n![Test](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TSvZKkzZ9mY/V9PhdzD344I/AAAAAAAAAGI/3B3Q4EkLhAMfY6es3CeUYzzDTxlWGEavACLcB/s1600/oil-distillation.gif)\n(Image from [here](http://allabtinstru.blogspot.com/2016/09/ProcessofRefiningCrudeOil.html))\n- Distillation Tower - Used in the refining of crude oil\n    - Outputs\n        - Lubricant - Used as a booster for new crafters (less power/less craft time)\n        - Fuel Oil - Used in liquid fuelled boilers for high pressure steam\n- Cracking Unit - Addon for distillation tower\n    - Additional outputs\n        - Kerosene - Used for new unit fuelling\n        - Propane - Used for power generation\n        - Diesel - Used for new unit fuelling        \n\n### Factories\n- TODO\n    - Items\n        - Vanilla upgrades\n            - Copper (wires, plates)\n            - Lead (batteries?)\n            - Graphite (TODO)\n            - Titanium (rods?, plates)\n            - Thorium (rods, plates)\n            - Silicon (circuits)\n            - Plastanium (TODO)\n            - Phase Fabric (TODO)\n            - Surge Alloy (rods, plates)\n            - Spore Pod (TODO)\n            - Sand (?)\n            - Blast/Pyratitem\n            - Metaglass (capsules/containers)\n\n### Workforce\n- General\n    - New units require fuel to operate\n    - Refuelling stations - requires petrol\n        - Dedicated stations or also smaller slower filling at factory.\n- Roles\n    - Utility\n        - New miner with drop-off at factory or specific storage block.\n    - Defence\n        - TODO\n    - Offence\n        - TODO\n\n### Logic System\n- Basic\n    - Wire with on/off signal\n    - Gates (AND, OR, NOT)\n    - Readers\n        - Inventory reader (signal based on item count)\n        - Tank reader (signal based on liquid count)\n        - Power reader (signal based on power input/output/usage)\n"}, {"name": "ProximityCatz/CreepLand", "stars": 0, "date": "2019-11-03 13:51:39", "sha": "ef19f57c3dd599359b94f44c1bb740cbb53250ef", "mod": {"name": "CreepLand", "description": "New [red]crazy[] [orange]technologies[], [green]materials[] and []enemies[]!
